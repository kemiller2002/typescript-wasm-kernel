# ROS Agent Bootstrap

Follow this sequence before beginning work.

## 1. Read operating instructions

1. `framework/REP-SPECIFICATION.md`
2. `framework/policies/RESEARCH-POLICY.md`
3. `framework/policies/EVIDENCE-POLICY.md`
4. `framework/policies/OUTPUT-POLICY.md`
5. `framework/protocols/ARTIFACT-LIFECYCLE.md`
6. `framework/protocols/SUPERSESSION.md`
7. Any standards or discipline-specific profiles named by the mission

## 2. Read current shared context

1. `context/CURRENT-STATE.md`
2. `context/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `context/DECISIONS.md`
4. `context/KNOWN-RISKS.md`
5. Relevant project or domain context

## 3. Read the assigned mission

Read only the mission and source records needed to execute it. Do not load
the entire repository without a reason.

## 4. Execute

Before meaningful repository mutation, establish attributable intent with `./ros work begin WORK-ID` and inspect `./ros work context WORK-ID` for allowed actions and required evidence. Use `./ros status` for a compact repository check. Follow `docs/work-protocol.md`.

- Identify the largest material uncertainty.
- Form explicit hypotheses.
- Seek supporting and contradicting evidence.
- Attempt to falsify conclusions.
- Preserve source traceability.
- Use deterministic tools before generative inference where practical.
- Record failures and invalidated assumptions.

## 5. Record results

Create or update the appropriate canonical artifacts:

- Journal: `research/journals/`
- REP: `research/packages/`
- Evidence: `research/evidence/`
- Hypotheses: `research/hypotheses/`
- Theories: `research/theories/`
- Experiments: `research/experiments/`

Run `./ros registry build`; registries are generated and must not be edited
manually. Then run `./ros validate`.

## 6. Handoff

The next agent must be able to reconstruct the work, understand the current
theory, and continue without additional conversational context.
